Get current operating system version

PROBLEM ADDRESSED

In situations where operating systems are being installed and
tested, the problem sometimes arises of the current operating
system version having to be identified in order to adapt jobs
appropriately. This functionality can also be required when an
application has to adapt its processing depending on the
operating system currently running.

SOLUTION

The GETOSLVL program obtains the current operating system version
and release from the Extended Communications Vector Table (ECVT).

The program displays this information (for simplicity the TPUT
service is used; this means that the display is made only in TSO
the WTO service with routing code 11 could be used to output the
display on the job log). The program returns a hash code formed
from the operating system name, the version, and the release. The
application can use this returned hash code to perform the
appropriate processing.

EXAMPLES

The following list shows the output for some recent operating systems:
  Hash code for OS/390 V2.8: 1819 (X'71B'):
OS/39Ø Ø2Ø8ØØ
  Hash code for OS/390 V2.10: 1555 (X'613'):
OS/39Ø Ø21ØØØ
  Hash code for z/OS V1.2: 3968 (X'F80'):
z/OS Ø1Ø2ØØ
  Hash code for z/OS V2.5: 3972 (X'F84'):
z/OS Ø2Ø5ØØ

The hash code is a numeric value within the range 0-4095 that the
program sets as a return code.
